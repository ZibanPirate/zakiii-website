I gotta say, it was a great year, i met with lot of people, made new and awesome friends, and shared with them great ideas.
what a great year to be alive!

So, let me try and resume the last year in this article, i will go throw almost everything that happened to me during this year, both personally and professionally, hope you'll enjoy the reading as much i enjoyed the writing.

## I Read Books, Paper Books

This actually started back in late 2018, where i found my brother's book sitting on the table, i could hear it calling for me to read it, and so i did, and started to get a taste of reading paper books, it felt better than reading text on screen, and definitely better then watching films and series, and that's because, instead of just watching, you will use your brain and imaging what's happening in the story while your eyes are resting on the papers of the book.

So yeah, i liked the process, and shortly after i finished reading my first ever book, i switched to others, one by one, and never stopped, although i didn't read that many, it's still not bad for my first time, or is it??

Maybe one of the reasons i kept on reading paper books, is the wasted time on the university bus, after i moved to the city, i stared taking the bus to the university, which takes up to 30 to 40 minutes, times 2, that's more then a full hour everyday, and durning that time, i usually sit and never talk to anyone, what made me think of using it for something useful, and yes you guessed it, i started reading in the bus, in fact, i finished more then 5 books mostly in the bus, what's even more, i made new friends, on the bus! just because they thought i was reading one of their favorite books, which happened to be true sometimes.

### The Alchemist

This is my brother's book, and the first ever i read, a novel by Paulo Coelho, that tells the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of his treasure.

I won't say no more, you can check my review of the book here:

### Veronika Decides to Die

Then i got another novel from a friend, by the same author, the one and only Paulo Coelho, this one tells the story of 24-year-old Slovenian Veronika, who appears to have everything in life going for her, but who decides to kill herself, why? read the book to know why, it's a great story, definitely worth reading.

You can also check my review of the book here:

### Wuthering Heights

This one is a bit dark, got it from another friend, a novel by by Emily BrontÃ«, about a wild, passionate story of the intense and almost demonic love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father.

You can tell already how the story will go, but i will let you read it, and hopefully enjoy it as much as i did. It actually has a film which i watched, mmm not bad i would say, anyway, check my review of the book here:

### A Tale of Two Cities

This one is my favorite, from the same one who gave me the last book, she also gave me this one too, A Tale of Two Cities, an 1859 historical novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.

I can safely say: this short stroy is my favorite sofar, you gonna want to read it, check my review here:

### The Winner Stands Alone

I like this one too, i kinda relate to it somehow, maybe i'm not a winner, but i definitely stand alone. This novel by Paulo Coelho is one of my favorite, it talks about the fascinating worlds of fortune and celebrity. in fact this is the last English book i read in the last year, before i switched to French books.

Here's my review of the book:

## Started Reading Manga (in English)

It stared when i finished one of my favorite anime, One Punch Man, i couldn't wait for a whole year for the next season, so i jumped straight to reading its manga, and eventually got hooked.

While i was sure having fun, the fact that the mangas that i read are translated to English, is a actually a plus, since i'm enjoying the manga, while at the same time learning English, so yeah the manga is one of the big reasons i got this far in English.

Now. i'm constantly reading manga, and i have three main ones that i simply can't skip: One Piece, One Punch Man, and Attack On Titan.

## Graduated with Master Degree

Last summer, i got my master degree, where i officially became an Electrical Engineer, don't let the title fool you, i'm still until this day, passionate about IT and Computer Science, and don't really care about Electronics, fun fact, my graduation project is 80% IT the rest is some an Electronic circuit and some math theories.

I was one of the few who chose to use English instead of French, that's i'm truly proud of, and i encourage everyone to do the same.

Little bit about my project, well it's basically a Desktop application (Electron), that you can use to generate Electrical signals, which you can send to an Electrical inverter. I developed the application in a way that lets you control every aspect of the generated signal, and i made sure that the Arduino board can handle any signal you gave it, yes, i was literally messing with its registers to get the best performance possible.

This is just talk, so where is the actual app? well i'm gonna open source it in the near future, and put it on Github, both Desktop and Arduino codes, so stay tuned for that:

## Attended Entrepreneurship Events

In late 2018, i participated in ELIP (Entrepreneurship, Leadership & Innovation Program), which is a program composed of bunch of events, across Wilayas, and couple more national ones, i spent great time durning those events, learned about design thinking, got out of my comfort zone, and met with great people, people that i can say will be able to change our country for the better.

I also learned the fact that, IT guys are so necessary for today's business, web developer specifically are the key to each startup, so yeah, i was under heavy demand there, what made me make lot of great friends, and enlarge my network even more.

## Attended my First Hackathon (Tizi Ouzou)

This is a good one. I finlay went to Tizi Ouzou, i've been wanting to go there for so long. So, i attended my first ever hackathon, it was great, i met with great people there, new and old friends, we shared really good moments and learned a lot together, and shared our knowledge with each other, the experience was great overall.

Hackathon are for solving real life problem, and this one is no exception, it focused on two main themes: Tourism, and Environment.
Teams came from across the country, with innovative ideas.

I came to the hackathon with an Afro-like hair and with a unique idea, well that's what i thought, until i met with this cool afro girl, which happens to have the same idea as mine, with slight difference in BMC, so yeah, no matter how special you think you are, there are always people who will surprise you.

## Built my First Professional Desktop Application (Electron)

Heard of Electron? it's a cool technology, it helps ease the process of developing Cross-platform Desktop apps, using web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

So, a client from Upwork wanted to build a desktop app, using Electron, this app connects to IRacing game simulator, and read realtime data, and display it as widgets in the screen, so it's basically an extension to the game.

Sofar the app is in Alpha, we released it for couple of users only, i will let you know when it's available, so stay tuned here:

## Started Learning French

As far as IT jobs in Algeria are concerned, you **NEED** to have good level of the French language, which i'm really struggling at, that goes for nearby countries too such as France, i received invitations fo job interviews, 90% of them didn't go well because they require French, although i'm good at english, that's unfortunate.

So i thought of starting to learn French, it's not like i don't know it at all, i know the basics of course, and i can understand it in most cases, but i can't do a proper back and forth discussion, even with my French friends, i can only talk in english, My strategy is to start with Books, French Books, French Paper books!

### L'Ã‰tranger

I got this book from a friend who studies the French language, she recommended me this book, so i took it and read it, "L'etranger", a 1942 novel by French author Albert Camus, definitely worth your time especially the time you spend in bus ;)

Here's my review of the first french book i read:

## Switched from Gitlab to GitHub

Since Github introduced Unlimited private repos, Github Actions CI for private repos with MacOS and Windows support, i had no reason to stick with Gitlab anymore, though there was a fundamental features that GitLab has and Github doesn't, which is project management board, but after some research, i found ZenHub, which does the same thing if not better, and integrates well with Github, in fact they require u to have a Github account.

## Discovered Firebase, and Kinda Ditched Heroku

Well at least for my own projects, i will go with firebase from now on, why not, after all:
- I can host up to 10 apps (1GB storage, and 10GB/m bandwidth).
- My web apps will never go down due to traffic.
- I can add custom domains that i already own, to any of my web apps.
- I get free SSL as a bonus.
- Deployment is so easy, just run `firebase deploy`.

## Built Zakiii.com

late 2019, i started developing zakiii.com, and published in the first of 2020, my goal is to Share my knowledge, showcase my realizations, and work on my online presence since i'm a developer that needs leads, and i can get those leads by building a good portfolio, for both client and employers.

i want to take this chance and thank my friend [Imad](https://www.instagram.com/imadabdennouri) for making a great logo for this website, you rock bro!

### Created Zakiii YouTube channel

I also created zakiii YouTube channel, i'm planning to add some videos that i believe will add values, and not just repeating what's already available on the platform, so let me know if there's a topic that i need to focus on.

If you are interested, here's a link to my YouTube channel:

## Lastly

I myself, didn't realise what i did accomplish this year, until i started writing this article, so i encourage you to do so, and start writing down what u have done this last year, it will help you feel better about yourself, and encourage you to do more.
as Bill Gates said:

 > If you canâ€™t make good, at least make it look good

Finlay, thank you for taking the time to read this article! you rock!
